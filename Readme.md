## The amazing precision of heart

Did you know your heart beats around 115000 times a day? An electrical system controls the rhythm of the blood pump inside our torso, that is also extremely precise at its job. But, how does doctors know, that a patient has a healthy heart or not?

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a measure of how the electrical activity of the heart changes over time as action potentials propagate throughout the heart during each cardiac cycle. In which our heart beats looks like the gif at the top from a cardiyogram perspective.

First you will need a ECG data to play on. Maybe use [this](ecg-id-database-1.0.0.zip) which is taken from [here.](https://physionet.org/content/ecgiddb/1.0.0/) These records were obtained from volunteers (44 men and 46 women aged from 13 to 75 years old.)

After you decide the file you want to use, just run matlab, open the [code](ECG_processing.m), have fun with it.You might want to see the R peaks, maybe you would want to decide the QRS timing. All included in the code.

You will see different figures to be printed out. This is made to be able to report different question parts given in the project.

It is crazy to think about it, that our heart just works, non-stop. Actually that is not exactly true, between every P - QRS - T cycle it rests for a bit. 

But yeah, magical.


## Help, I'm Stuck!

For any questions regarding on how to open the code and play around matlab, how to maintain eye contact with someone you have just met and maybe how to succeed in life & chase your dreams, feel free to contact [Sezai](mailto:sezaiburakkantarci@gmail.com) from the mail.
